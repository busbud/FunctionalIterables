# Iterables
A bunch of Iterable functions for more fluent functionnal programming, for Java 7

Because other solutions are too big and complex, this fit in a single file and does a limited number of things.

## TODO
- Actually work with java 7
- Create the basic functions. iter(array), chain, flatten, map, filter, find, reduce, max, sum (longs and doubles), zip?, all?, any?, range? This looks a lot like python builtins
- Publish on maven central, add the gradle line here
- Create a fluent wrapper around Iterable to chain calls
